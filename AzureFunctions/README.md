# Kendo UI Grid Consuming Data from Azure Functions
This example demonstrates how to configure a Kendo UI Grid to consume data from `Azure Functions`. The implementation shows full CRUD operations for the Grid data source. The Azure Functions implementation uses Azure Table Storage as data store.

This folder contains:
* Azure Functions application using `Table Storage` and `C#`;
* The Kendo UI Grid implementation, which cosumes the data from Azure Functions;

[Here you could find detailed instructions on how to configure the Azure Functions app and the Kendo UI Grid widget.](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/kendo-in-the-cloud/azure-functions)
