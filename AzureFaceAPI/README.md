# Integrating Kendo UI with Azure Face API

The Kendo UI widgets can be seamlessly integrated with a cognitive service such as [Azure Face API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/). The cloud-based Face API provides access to a set of advanced face algorithms, that enable developers to detect and identify faces in images.

## Documentation

For a detailed guide on how to configure the template refer to [the Azure FaceAPI Integration Article in the Kendo UI Documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/kendo-in-the-cloud/azure-faceapi).

## Step-by-step Guide

* Replace the `subscriptionKey` value with your valid subscription key that is obtained from Azure.
